# FINAL-PROJECT
This project analyzes Amazon e-commerce sales data to extract insights into product performance, profitability, and customer behavior. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib), the analysis includes data cleaning, trend identification, return rate analysis, and visualizations to support data-driven business decisions.
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon's e-commerce sales data to extract valuable business insights using Python. The dataset includes thousands of records across multiple features such as product categories, shipping status, order date, profit, and customer location.

The goal is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to understand sales performance, product returns, seasonal trends, and customer behavior.
